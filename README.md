# chm-html

A tool to create HTML5 powered CHM browsers.

# Usage

`python chm-html.py DIRECTORY`

Run the chm-html.py script with a CHM's source directory as the first argument and it will output a portable "gen_chm.html" file containing the browser packaged with the chm. If `DIRECTORY` is unspecified it will use the current working directory.
